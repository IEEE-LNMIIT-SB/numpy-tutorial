### Introduction

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

-   a powerful N-dimensional array object
-   sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
-   tools for integrating C/C++ 
-   useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
Arbitrary data-types can be defined and this allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of projects. We are going to
explore numpy through a simple example.
